          | SIP express media server  - README |
          +------------------------------------+


Introduction:

 Sems is a extensible media server which helps you
 adding voice services to your VoIP system.

 Each module or plug-in extends your system. Audio
 plug-ins enable new codecs and file format whereby 
 application plug-ins implements the service's logic.

 You can easely extend Sems by creating your own plug-ins.

 The following default modules are shipped with Sems stable version:

 * Voicemail: records voice messages and mail them to the callee.

 * ISDN Gateway: support calls from and to the PSTN.

 * Conferencing: enables many people to talk together
                 at the same time.

 * Announcement: plays an announcement.

 * Number reader: reads the called number.

 * Echo: test module echoing your voice.

Some new services like IVR, Text-To-Speech, MP3 and iLBC support are only
available in the developement version of Sems.

Sems only support patent free codecs. Which means that we won't support codecs
like g729. On the other hand, we have support for all important patent free
(g711u, g711a, GSM06.10 and iLBC).

Requirements:

 1. Ser version >= 0.8.12: SIP Epress Router (www.iptel.org/ser)

    - Sems requires Ser as its SIP stack. 
    - Sems & Ser communicate together through FIFO file, which means that a Ser
      instance is mandatory on every host using Sems.


Installation:

 1. Download Sems through CVS:

    Stable version:

      export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/sems
      cvs co -r ser_rel_0_8_12 answer_machine

    Developement version:

      export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/sems
      cvs co answer_machine


 2. Compile Sems:

      make all
      make install

    Notice: you don't need to execute 'make install' if you want to run Sems
            from the source tree.


 3. Look at the default configuration file if it fits your need:

      If you installed Sems with 'make install', the configuration
      is at '/etc/sems/sems.conf'. Else make your own using sems.conf.sample.


 4. Start Ser: 

      Please read the Ser User's guide if you don't known
      how to complete this stage.

 5. Start Sems:

      If you installed Sems with 'make install', sems can be
      found at '/usr/local/sbin/sems'.
      If you need help starting 'sems', try 'sems -h'.


Troubleshooting:

 * RH thread problem:

  Sems has currently problems being run on Redhat 9. If you cannot wait 
  until it is fixed, you may want to run ans_machine after running the
  following command:

  export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1

  This disables the new pthread implementation included in Redhat 9.


Installed file using 'make install':

    /etc/sems/sems.conf                  : configuration file.
    /usr/local/sbin/sems                 : Sems executable.
    /usr/local/lib/sems/plug-in/*        : plug-ins.
    /usr/local/lib/sems/audio/*          : default path for audio files.
    /usr/local/share/doc/sems/README     : this README.

    source_path/scripts/sems[.redhat]    : example start-up scripts.
    source_path/sems.conf.example        : example configuration file.
