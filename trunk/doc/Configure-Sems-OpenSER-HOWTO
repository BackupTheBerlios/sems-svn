*  Sems + OpenSER mini-HOWTO  *
*******************************

SEMS 1.0 includes plugin sipctrl.so, which turns SEMS into a regular,
RFC3261 compliant SIP user agent.  No special interaction is thus
anymore needed between SEMS and OpenSER.  Just follow the general SEMS
instructions on how to configure the user agent and how to select an
application that SEMS executes upon receiving initial INVITE.
