          | SIP express media server  - README |
          +------------------------------------+


Introduction:

 Sems is a extensible media server which helps you
 adding voice services to your VoIP system.

 Each module or plug-in extends your system. Audio
 plug-ins enable new codecs and file format whereby 
 application plug-ins implements the service's logic.

 You can easely extend Sems by creating your own plug-ins.

 The following default applications are shipped with Sems :

 * voicemail: records voice messages and mail them to the callee.

 * conferencing: enables many people to talk together
                 at the same time.

 * announcement: plays an announcement.

 * echo: test module echoing your voice.
 
 * mailbox: saves voicemails into an IMAP server. Users 
            can dial in to check their messages

 * ann_b2b: plays ann announcement before connecting the callee
            in b2bua mode

 * conf_auth: collect a PIN number, verify it against an 
              XMLRPC authentication server and connect in b2bua mode

 * early_announce: announcement for early media (183)


 Sems only support patent free codecs. Which means that we won't support codecs
 like g729. On the other hand, we have support for all important patent free
 (g711u, g711a, GSM06.10 and iLBC).

Requirements:

 1. Ser version 0.9.6: SIP Epress Router (www.iptel.org/ser)

    - Sems requires Ser as its SIP stack. 
    - Sems & Ser communicate together through socket, which means that a Ser
      instance is mandatory on every host using Sems.

 2. Python version >= 2.3 for the ivr (embedded python interpreter), optional

 3. flite speech synthesizer for TTS in the ivr, optional

 4. lame >= 3.95 for mp3 file output, optional

Installation:

 1. Download Sems through svn:
    svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/sems/trunk
      -or-
    svn checkout http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/sems/trunk 

 2. Compile Sems:

      make all
      make install

    Notice: you don't need to execute 'make install' if you want to run Sems
            from the source tree.
     
    For detailed instructions, have a look at COMPILING as well.

 3. Look at the default configuration file whether it fits your need:

      If you installed Sems with 'make install', the configuration
      is at '/usr/local/etc/sems/sems.conf'. 
      Else make your own using sems.conf.sample.

 4. Start Ser: 

      Please read the Ser User's guide if you don't known
      how to complete this stage.

 5. Start Sems:

      If you installed Sems with 'make install', sems can be
      found at '/usr/local/sbin/sems'.
      If you need help starting 'sems', try 'sems -h'.


Troubleshooting:

 * RH thread problem:

  Sems has currently problems being run on Redhat 9. If you cannot wait 
  until it is fixed, you may want to run ans_machine after running the
  following command:

  export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1

  This disables the new pthread implementation included in Redhat 9.


Installed file using 'make install':

    /usr/local/etc/sems/sems.conf                  : configuration file.
    /usr/local/sbin/sems                 : Sems executable.
    /usr/local/lib/sems/plug-in/*        : plug-ins.
    /usr/local/lib/sems/audio/*          : default path for audio files.
    /usr/local/lib/sems/ivr/*            : precompiled IVR scripts
    /usr/local/share/doc/sems/README     : this README.

    source_path/scripts/sems[.redhat]    : example start-up scripts.
    source_path/sems.conf.example        : example configuration file.
