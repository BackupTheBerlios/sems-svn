myjukebox

This application demonstrates how to use the B2BUA with media relay.
After calling the B leg party, the audio of both legs are connected.
Whenever the caller presses a key, the file with the corresponding 
name (0.wav, 1.wav, ...) is played to both caller and callee, so the
caller can play jukebox or use funny pre-recorded comments and sounds.
