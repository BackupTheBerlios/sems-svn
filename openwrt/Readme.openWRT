SEMS on OpenWRT

This is for building SEMS for embedded devices running
OpenWRT. Set default_application in /etc/sems.conf after
installation.

This is tested and works using libstdc++, which must me 
available on the device. A currently broken version with
uClibc++ can be found in uClibc++/ folder.

Tested on Kamikaze / BCM47xx MIPS with libstdc++ 6.0.3.
