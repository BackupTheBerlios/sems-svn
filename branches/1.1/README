          +------------------------------------+


Introduction:

 SEMS is a free, high performance, extensible media server 
 for SIP (RFC3261) based VoIP services. 

 It is intended to complement proxy/registrar servers
 in VoIP networks for all applications where server-
 side processing of audio is required, for example away 
 or pre-call announcements, voicemail, or network side 
 conferencing. 

 SEMS can be used to implement simple high performance 
 components like announcement servers as building 
 blocks of more complex applications, or, using its powerful 
 framework for application development including back-to-back 
 user agent (B2BUA) functionality, complex VoIP services
 can be realized completely in SEMS. 
 
 The following applications are shipped with SEMS :

  * announcement   plays an announcement

  * voicemail      records voice messages and sends them 
                   as email, saves them to a voicebox, or
                   both

  * conference     enables many people to talk together 
                   at the same time

  * webconference  conference application that can be 
                   controlled from an external program, 
                   e.g. a website 

  * echo           test module to echo the caller's voice
 
  * voicebox       users can dial in to the voicebox to check
                   their messages

  * annrecorder    users can record their personal greeting 
                   message

  * mailbox        auto-attendant that saves voicemails into
                   an IMAP server. Users can dial in to check
                   their messages (simpler version)

  * ann_b2b        pre-call-announcement, plays announcement 
                   before connecting the callee in B2BUA mode
 
  * announce_transfer  pre-call-announcement, plays announcement 
                   and then transfers the caller to the callee 
                   using REFER

  * early_announce (pre-call) announcement using early media (183),
                   optionally continues the call in B2BUA mode

  * auth_b2b       B2BUA app that changes identity and authenticates
                   second call leg

  * conf_auth      collect a PIN number, verify it against an 
                   XMLRPC authentication server and connects in 
                   B2BUA mode

  * pin_collect    collect a PIN, optionally verify it, and transfer
                   the call into a conference

  * callback       reject the call, call back caller later and have 
                   her enter a number to call in b2bua with media relay
                   mode

  * reg_agent     SIP REGISTER to register SEMS' contact to an aor

  * sw_prepaid_sip prepaid application
  
  * call_timer     B2BUA, ends the call after a certain time

  * precoded_announce plays preencoded announcements


 alongside a set of example applications intended to help 
 development of custom services, including a calling card 
 application, a traffic generator, a component to control the 
 media server via XMLRPC, and announcements played from DB. 

 SEMS' core implements basic call and audio processing, 
 and loads plug-ins which extend the system. Audio
 plug-ins enable new codecs and file formats, 
 application plug-ins implement the services' logic.
 Other modules called component modules provide 
 functionality for other modules to use.

 You can easily extend SEMS by creating your own plug-ins.
 Applications can be written using the SEMS framework API 
 in C++, or in Python using an embedded python interpreter 
 of the ivr or py_sems modules.

 SEMS only supports patent free codecs. That means that codecs
 like g729 won't be supported. On the other hand, SEMS supports 
 all important patent free codecs out of the box (g711u, g711a, 
 GSM06.10, speex, G726, L16 and iLBC). Integrating other codecs 
 in SEMS is very simple.

 SEMS shows very good performance on current standard
 PC architecture based server systems. It has sucessfully
 been run with 1200 G.711 conference channels on a quad-core
 Intel(R) Xeon at 2GHz (700 GSM, 280 iLBC channels). On the 
 other hand it also runs on very small devices - for example 
 small embedded systems like routers running OpenWRT, for which 
 of course the achievable channel count is not that high.

Requirements:

 1. optional: SER version 0.9.6-sems, or SER 2.0 with SASI:
    SIP Epress Router (www.iptel.org/ser)

    SEMS has its own SIP stack. SEMS can also use SER as its 
    SIP stack. SEMS & SER communicate through unix socket (0.9.6),
    or binrpc protocol (2.0 SASI).

 2. Python version >= 2.3 for the ivr (embedded python interpreter)
    and py_sems, optional

 3. flite speech synthesizer for TTS in the ivr, optional

 4. lame >= 3.95 for mp3 file output, optional. mpg123 for mp3 playback,
    optional

 5. xmlrpcpp for XMLRPC control, optional

 6. spandsp library for DTMF detection and PLC, optional
    (SEMS has its own implementations for both)

 7. libZRTP SDK (http://zfoneproject.com) for ZRTP, optional

How to get started with SEMS:

  To try out SEMS, the easiest is to get a release candidate from 
  http://ftp.iptel.org/pub/sems/testing/ , unpack and install it 
  using the usual make && make install. After installation, the 
  configuration file /usr/local/etc/sems/sems.conf needs to be 
  adapted.
 
  You can also follow one of the tutorials
  linked from the SEMS homepage
  (e.g. http://www.iptel.org/howto_sems_voicemail).The Application
  Modules Documentation page then gives an overview of the application
  modules that come with SEMS 
  (http://ftp.iptel.org/pub/sems/doc/current/AppDoc.html).
  
  If you are interested in writing your own applications, the 
  application development tutorial is a good start 
  (http://www.iptel.org/sems/sems_application_development_tutorial),
  together  with the design overview 
  (http://www.iptel.org/files/semsng-designoverview.pdf) and the example
  applications (apps/examples/).
  
Installation:

 1. Download SEMS 
     Download the source tarball from ftp://ftp.iptel.org/pub/sems/,
     or get the newest version through svn:
      $ svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/sems/trunk
       -or-
      $ svn checkout http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/sems/trunk 

 2. Compile SEMS

      $ make all
      $ make install

    Notice: you don't need to execute 'make install' if you want to 
            run SEMS from the source tree, but in this case some paths 
            in the config files will need to be adapted.
            If you want to install to a different prefix than /usr/local,
            use PREFIX=/some/other/prefix 
     
    For detailed instructions for some modules, have a look at
    doc/COMPILING as well.

 3. Look at the default configuration file whether it fits your need:

    If you installed SEMS with 'make install', the configuration
    is at '/usr/local/etc/sems/sems.conf'. 
    Else make your own using sems.conf.sample.

 4. Optional, needed if you want to use SER as SEMS frontend (SIP stack):
    Get and start SER as SIP stack for SEMS: 
    
    By default, sipctrl plugin is loaded, which is the integrated SIP 
    stack for SEMS. If SER should be used, the following procedure is
    necessary for ser 0.9.6-sems as SIP stack: 
    o To install the ser-0.9.6-sems into the directory /some/dir the 
      following commands can used:

      $ wget http://ftp.iptel.org/pub/sems/ser-0.9.6-sems_src.tar.gz
      $ tar xzvf ser-0.9.6-sems_src.tar.gz
      $ cd ser-0.9.6-sems
      $ make install PREFIX=/some/dir

      With the install target install-ser-cfg, e.g. using 
       $ make install-ser-cfg SERPREFIX=/some/dir 
      you can install a general ser-sems.cfg which will work with 
      ser-0.9.6-sems and make SER to act only as SIP stack for SEMS, i.e. 
      direct every request to SEMS. Then 
       $ /some/dir/sbin/ser -f /some/dir/etc/ser/ser-sems.cfg
      runs SER on port 5070. This way, several versions of SER can be 
      used on the same server, e.g. a different version of SER as Registrar
      server.

    o For ser 2.0/sasi use this patched ser2.0 version:
      http://ftp.iptel.org/pub/sems/ser2-sasi-080108.tar.bz2 
      (or ser head with patches from the bug tracker at 
       http://tracker.iptel.org/browse/SER-346 )    
      and core/etc/ser-sems.sasi.cfg.

 5. Start SEMS:

    If you installed SEMS with 'make install', sems can be
    found at '/usr/local/sbin/sems'.
    If you need help starting 'sems', try 'sems -h'.

 6. Using SEMS
    
    SEMS needs to be told from the many possible applications that are
    loaded which one to run. You can simply set the application 
    in sems.conf, e.g. application=conference. You can also define an
    application mapping, i.e. numbers (R-URIs) that will be mapped to
    applications, see the explanation of 'application' parameter in 
    sems.conf.
   
    Alternatively, the SIP-stack-SER can be configured in ser-sems.cfg
    to send all calls directly to one application, in that case the line
     if(!t_write_unix("/tmp/sems_sock","sems/app_headers"))
    in ser-sems.cfg could be changed to e.g.
     if(!t_write_unix("/tmp/sems_sock","conference"))
    A sample ser.cfg file in this style can be found at 
    http://ftp.iptel.org/pub/sems/ser.cfg

    For more information please refer to doc/Configure-SEMS-Ser-HOWTO and
    the SER User's guide.
