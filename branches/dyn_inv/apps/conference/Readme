Description:
------------

The 'conference' plug-in works very easy: 
every call having the same request URI will 
be in the same conference room.

Dialout feature:
----------------

Dialout is supported through AVT tones. Somebody
who has been 'dialed out' cannot use this functionnality
due to billing issues. If you still want that, you can 
turn it out in the code (search for 'if(dialedout)').

keys:
 - '#*' to trigger dialout. Then type in the number and finish with '*'.
 - you be first connected to the callee only
 - press '*' to connect the callee to the conference.
 - press '#' to drop the call.
