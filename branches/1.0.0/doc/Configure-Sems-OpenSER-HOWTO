*  Sems + OpenSER mini-HOWTO  *
*******************************

Sems 1.0 includes plugin sipctrl.so, which turns Sems into a regular,
RFC3261 compliant SIP user agent.  No special interaction is thus
anymore needed between Sems and OpenSER.  Just follow the general Sems
instructions on how to configure the user agent and how to select an
application that Sems executes upon receiving initial INVITE.

In version 1.0 of Sems, it is still possible to use the old Unix socket
interface between Sems and OpenSER by loading plugin unixsockctrl.so
instead of plugin sipctrl.so.  If you decide to do that, then follow the
instructions in Configure-Sems-OpenSER-HOWTO of version 0.10.0 of Sems.
Note, however, that this old interface is not anymore supported and will
be completely removed in the next version of Sems.
